# RT-950 Pro CHIRP Driver Workspace

This repository tracks reverse-engineering notes, tooling, and implementation work for adding Baofeng Tech RT-950 Pro clone-mode support to [CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com/).

## Repository Layout
- `DESIGN.md` - fixed definition of done, protocol notes, and memory map.
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - living status log and task board tied to the design.
- `AGENTS.md` - primary contacts and collaboration expectations.
- `Reference/` - vendor CPS decompilation and clean-room export utility from prior work.

## Development Environment
1. Create and activate a Python 3.11 virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   c:\\Python\\python_3.11\\python.exe -m venv .venv
   .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
2. Install dependencies as they are added: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Keep tooling Python-only so tests can run without a CHIRP install; CHIRP integration will reference the same modules.

## Planned Tooling
- Standalone harness to decode/encode RT-950 Pro `.dat` images.
- CSV translator compatible with `Reference/950Pro Export` artifacts for regression checks.
- Optional serial transport wrapper for talking to a physical radio when connected.

## Harness Commands
- `python -m rt950pro image summary <image.dat> [--limit N]` - summarise populated channels in a raw clone image.
- `python -m rt950pro image dat-summary <codeplug.dat> [--limit N] [--assembly path]` - summarise channels from a CPS `.dat` file (requires `pythonnet` and the vendor assembly).
- `python -m rt950pro regression dat-csv <codeplug.dat> <channels.csv> [--assembly path] [--limit N]` - compare CPS `.dat` channel data with the CSV export.
- `python -m rt950pro channel decode --hex <64-hex-chars>` - decode a single 32-byte channel blob into JSON.
- `python -m rt950pro channel encode ...` - placeholder; emits a `MOCK:` warning until implemented.

## Testing Philosophy
- Prefer end-to-end binary comparisons over mocks; when mocking is unavoidable, log a warning so the shim can be revisited.
- Validate against known-good `.dat` files before exercising a physical radio.
- Document every new test command in `IMPLEMENTATION.md` to keep alignment with the design.

## Contributing
- Review `DESIGN.md` for scope; propose design changes before editing that file.
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION.md` with progress notes and open questions as work advances.
- Coordinate on-radio experiments with Nathan (_2E0NBS_).
